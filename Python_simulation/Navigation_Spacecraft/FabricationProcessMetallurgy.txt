//FALCON9 DESIGN-BLACKHOLE DESIGN(II)
Spacecraft Design Based on analysis of Frolov's vacuum solutions and Penrose holes,
a spacecraft prototype is designed with a rotating charged mass distribution
using Frolov's solutions, a Penrose hole-inspired propulsion system,
and a gravitational field generator to manipulate motion.
The propulsion system exploits exotic phenomena like closed timelike curves.
Metrics and mathematical structures include Kerr metric for gravitational field,
Penrose metric for spacetime geometry, and Newman-Penrose formalism for gravitational
 behavior. Prototype development involves design/testing of the field generator,
 propulsion system, and system integration. Deep understanding of physics and mathematics
 is required to use Frolov and Penrose hole concepts, with potential to revolutionize
 space travel through advances in gravity and extreme environments.
 An alternative concept uses a miniaturized stabilized black hole with exotic matter,
 manipulating the ergosphere and generating gravitational waves for extreme speeds.
 Modified Falcon 9 can launch this spacecraft. Questions remain about black hole
 stability and manipulation. Merlin engines (1A, 1B, 1C) evolved from simple to
 regeneratively cooled versions for Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 with power, cooling,
 and vector control improvements, with Merlin 1C used successfully in
 flights and further development for performance.

EXAMPLE 10.1
Solidification Times for Various Shapes Three metal pieces with the same volume but
different shapes are being cast a sphere a cube and a cylinder with a height equal to
its diameter Which of the pieces will solidify first and which will solidify
the slowest Assume n Solution Consider the volume of each piece as unity Then
from Equation 10.7 Solidification time r The surface areas are as follows

Therefore the respective solidification times are 5 54 thesphere 0 043C thecube 0 028C

will do so more slowly 10 5 2 Shrinkage Due to their thermal expansion characteristics
metals in general contract compress during solidification and cool to room temperature
Shrinkage which causes dimensional changes and sometimes cracking is the result of three
consecutive events 1 Shrinkage of the molten metal as it cools before solidifying
2 Shrinkage of the metal during the phase change from liquid to solid latent heat of fusion
3 Shrinkage of the solidified metal the casting as
its temperature is reduced to room temperature The greatest potential amount of
 shrinkage occurs when the casting cools to room temperature
 Table 10 1 shows the extent to which various metals shrink during solidification
